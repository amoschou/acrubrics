## Content descriptions

### Years 7 and 8
#### Nature and development of science
* (NDS1) Scientific knowledge has changed peoples’ understanding of the world and is refined as new evidence becomes available
* (NDS2) Science knowledge can develop through collaboration across the disciplines of science and the contributions of people from a range of cultures

#### Use and influence of science
* (UIS1) Solutions to contemporary issues that are found using science and technology, may impact on other areas of society and may involve ethical considerations
* (UIS2) People use science understanding and skills in their occupations and these have influenced the development of practices in areas of human activity

### Years 9 and 10
#### Nature and development of science
* (NDS1) Scientific understanding, including models and theories, is contestable and is refined over time through a process of review by the scientific community
* (NDS2) Advances in scientific understanding often rely on technological advances and are often linked to scientific discoveries

#### Use and influence of science
* (UIS1) People use scientific knowledge to evaluate whether they accept claims, explanations or predictions, and advances in science can affect people’s lives, including generating new career opportunities
* (UIS2) Values and needs of contemporary society can influence the focus of scientific research

### Senior secondary, Units 1 and 2
* Science is a global enterprise that relies on clear communication, international conventions, peer review and reproducibility
* Development of complex models and/or theories often requires a wide range of evidence from multiple individuals and across disciplines
* Advances in science understanding in one field can influence other areas of science, technology and engineering
* The use of scientific knowledge is influenced by social, economic, cultural and ethical considerations
* The use of scientific knowledge may have beneficial and/or harmful and/or unintended consequences
* Scientific knowledge can enable scientists to offer valid explanations and make reliable predictions
* Scientific knowledge can be used to develop and evaluate projected economic, social and environmental impacts and to design action for sustainability


### Senior secondary, Units 3 and 4
* ICT and other technologies have dramatically increased the size, accuracy and geographic and temporal scope of datasets with which scientists work
* Models and theories are contested and refined or replaced when new evidence challenges them, or when a new model or theory has greater explanatory power
* The acceptance of science understanding can be influenced by the social, economic and cultural context in which it is considered
* People can use scientific knowledge to inform the monitoring, assessment and evaluation of risk
* Science can be limited in its ability to provide definitive answers to public debate; there may be insufficient reliable data available, or interpretation of the data may be open to question
* International collaboration is often required when investing in large-scale science projects or addressing issues for the Asia-Pacific region
* Scientific knowledge can be used to develop and evaluate projected economic, social and environmental impacts and to design action for sustainability
