# Strands

The content strands are *number and algebra*, *measurement and geometry*, and *statistics and probability*. They describe what is to be taught and learnt.

## Number and algebra

Number and algebra are developed together, as each enriches the study of the other.

Students:

* apply number sense and strategies for counting and representing numbers
* explore the magnitude and properties of numbers
* apply a range of strategies for computation and understand the connections between operations
* recognise patterns and understand the concepts of variable and function
* build on their understanding of the number system to describe relationships and formulate generalisations
* recognise equivalence and solve equations and inequalities
* apply their number and algebra skills to conduct investigations, solve problems and communicate their reasoning.

## Measurement and geometry

Measurement and geometry are presented together to emphasise their relationship to each other, enhancing their practical relevance.

Students:

* develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of size, shape, relative position and movement of two-dimensional figures in the plane and three-dimensional objects in space
* investigate properties and apply their understanding of them to define, compare and construct figures and objects
* learn to develop geometric arguments
* make meaningful measurements of quantities, choosing appropriate metric units of measurement
* build an understanding of the connections between units and calculate derived measures such as area, speed and density


## Statistics and probability

Statistics and probability initially develop in parallel and the curriculum then progressively builds the links between them

Students:

* recognise and analyse data and draw inferences
* represent, summarise and interpret data and undertake purposeful investigations involving the collection and interpretation of data
* assess likelihood and assign probabilities using experimental and theoretical approaches
* develop an increasingly sophisticated ability to critically evaluate chance and data concepts and make reasoned judgements and decisions, as well as building skills to critically evaluate statistical information and develop intuitions about data
