# Science as a human endeavour, Year 8

## Achievement standard

By the end of Year 8,
Students examine the different science knowledge used in occupations. They explain how evidence has led to an improved understanding of a scientific idea and describe situations in which scientists collaborated to generate solutions to contemporary problems. They reflect on implications of these solutions for different groups in society.

## Rubric

| Grade | Use of science | Development of science | Nature of science | Influence of science |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| A | Examines the different science understanding and skills used in occupations and explains how these have influenced human life. | Analyses how a range of new evidence from multiple individuals and across disciplines leads to an improved and refined understanding of a scientific idea. | Explains situations in which scientists used science and technology and collaborated to generate solutions to contemporary problems. | Analyses implications of these referenced solutions for different groups in society with careful assessment of how ethical and technological factors are involved. |
| B | Examines the different science understanding and skills used in occupations and describes how these have influenced human life. | Explains how a range of evidence from multiple individuals and across disciplines has led to an improved understanding of a scientific idea. | Discusses situations in which scientists used science and technology and collaborated to generate solutions to contemporary problems. | Evaluates implications of these referenced solutions for different groups in society with consideration of how ethical and technological factors are involved. |
| C | Examines the different science knowledge used in occupations. | Explains how evidence has led to an improved understanding of a scientific idea. | Describes situations in which scientists collaborated to generate solutions to contemporary problems. | Reflects on implications of these referenced solutions for different groups in society. |
| D | Describes different science knowledge used in occupations. | Describes how evidence develops science knowledge. | Describes a situation in which scientists pursued solutions to contemporary problems. | Describes possible implications of the referenced solution for different groups in society |
| E | Identifies science knowledge used in occupations. | Identifies how evidence develops science knowledge. | Identifies a situation in which scientists pursued solutions to meet needs. | Identifies possible implications of the referenced solution for groups in society. |
